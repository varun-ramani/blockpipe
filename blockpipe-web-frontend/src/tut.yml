- title: Overview
  content: 
    This is an interactive tour of BlockPipe - you don't need to install
    anything. Each section features a code editor and some sort of exercise. You
    can execute your code in the browser by just clicking the play button next
    to each section - if it turns green you can move on, and if it turns orange,
    you need to correct something. Try it with this editor below - all you have
    to do for this exercise is click play.
  startingCode: |
    {
      "hello world"
    }
  expect: 
    "hello world"
- content: 
    The most basic unit of execution is the block - any piece of code (list of
    expressions) you surround with curly braces {}. Blocks execute the
    expressions they contain in order, and return the value the last one
    evaluates to. Try running this cell - can you add something to make this
    code print "bye"?
  expect: 
    "bye"
  startingCode: |
    { 1 2 3 4 }
  title: 
    The Block
- title: The Tuple
  content: 
    Tuples are a lot like blocks in the sense that they're basically lists of
    expressions, except you surround them with parentheses () instead of braces
    {}. However, (and we'll talk about this later) tuples are *eagerly
    evaluated* - evaluating a tuple requires evaluating all the expressions
    inside. Then, the results get packaged into a tuple value and returned. Try
    running the code below, then add the number 5 to the tuple.
  startingCode: |
    { ( 1 2 3 4 ) }
  expect:
    "(1 2 3 4 5)"
- title: Literal Types
  content: 
    Literal types are values you explicitly write in your program. You've
    already seen string literals and integer literals, but BlockPipe also has
    floats and booleans. Run the code below, then try to negate all the numbers
    and invert all the booleans (make true false and false true).
  startingCode: |
    {
      (
        "hello world"
        1 -2
        1.1 -4.2
        F T
      )
    }
  expect:
    (hello world -1 2 -1.1 4.2 true false)

- title: The Standard Pipe
  content: 
    In languages you might be used to, you invoke functions by passing them some
    arguments - like print("hello"). BlockPipe is no different, except you pass
    arguments by "piping" them. The "standard" pipe operator | binds whatever
    you pass it to the first argument $0. Run the code below, then try changing
    "hello" to the true boolean.
  startingCode: |
    { 
      "hello" | {$0}
    }
  expect:
    "true"

- title: The Destructure Pipe
  content: 
    What if you want to bind multiple arguments at the same time? The
    destructure pipe |* accepts a tuple as input, then binds the x'th value it
    contains to the x'th argument $x. Try running the code below - you'll notice
    it errors out. Change only the | to make it run.
  startingCode: |
    { 
      ( "hello" "world" ) | {
        $0
        $1
      }
    }
  expect:
    "world"

- title: The Closure
  content: 
    Blocks are also expressions, and they evaluate to something called a
    "closure". This is a concept from functional programming that describes code
    that has been packaged along with any external variables it depends on. So
    for instance, if a block refers to a variable 'x', then when the block is
    evaluated, BlockPipe will grab the value of 'x' from the environment and
    store it along with the block's code to form a closure. Piping data to a
    block triggers closure creation and execution. The root block is
    auto-evaluated and its closure auto-executed. Can you make the code from the
    previous exercise return a closure? 
  startingCode: |
    { 
      ( "hello" "world" ) | {
        $0
        $1
      }
    }
  expect:
    "<closure>"

- title: The Binding
  content: 
    We'd like to be able to assign names to values (including closures) so we
    can "save" them and refer to them later. The code below shows how you could
    bind a few example identifiers - can you bind a symbol 'c' to the value 3
    and change the code so it produces (1 2 3)? Hint - you'll need to create a
    new binding, edit an existing binding, edit the code inside print_values,
    and add c to a tuple.
  startingCode: |
    { 
      a: 1
      b: 4

      print_values: {
        $0
      }

      (a b) | print_values
    }
  expect:
    (1 2 3)

- title: Exercise with Binding/Pipes
  content: 
    It's time to combine what you've learned. The code below is supposed to
    create a function called "swap", feed integers named "a" and "b" to it, and
    result in (4 2) being printed. Can you use binding and some sort of pipe to
    make this happen? You should not delete any existing code.
  startingCode: |
    { 
      2
      4

      {
        ($1 $0)
      }

      (a b)
    }
  expect:
    (4 2)

- title: Plz "Hello World"
  content: 
    plz is a special closure that invokes runtime functionality - things that
    cannot be implemented in pure BlockPipe. This includes arithmetic,
    comparisons, I/O, and more. However, a local version of BlockPipe will
    provide some sort of runtime library such that programmers never have to use
    plz manually, and following exercises will provide convenient wrapper
    blocks. Try using the following add function to add 1 and 2.
  startingCode: |
    {
      add: {(($0 $1 "+") "binop_arith") |* plz}
    }
  expect:
    "3"

- title: Conditional Logic
  content:
    BlockPipe comes with an "if" statement. It accepts a boolean and two
    closures - the first for the true case and the second for the false case.
    Can you correct the pos_neg_zero function so that it correctly outputs each value's parity?
  startingCode: |
    {
      if: {(($0 $1 $2) "if") |* plz}
      lt: {(($0 $1 "<") "binop_cmp") |* plz}

      pos_neg_zero: {
        n: $0
        ((n 0) |* lt
         {"positive"}
         {((n 1) |* lt
           {"negative"}
           {"zero"}) |* if}) |* if
      }

      (-1 | pos_neg_zero
        0 | pos_neg_zero
        1 | pos_neg_zero)
    }
  expect:
    (negative zero positive)

- title: Recursion
  content: 
    To implement recursion in BlockPipe, you could just pass a closure to itself
    as a parameter using a binding. For convenience, BlockPipe binds the current
    closure to "rec" instead. Can you make a new recursive factorial
    implementation using rec, then compute 5 factorial using your own block
    instead of bad_factorial?
  startingCode: |
    {
      if: {(($0 $1 $2) "if") |* plz}
      lt: {(($0 $1 "<") "binop_cmp") |* plz}   
      sub: {(($0 $1 "-") "binop_arith") |* plz}   
      mul: {(($0 $1 "*") "binop_arith") |* plz}   

      bad_factorial: {
        fact: $0
        n: $1
        ((n 2) |* lt
         {1}
         {(n 1) |* sub 
                |  {(fact $0)}
                |* fact
                |  {(n $0)}
                |* mul}
        ) |* if
      }

      (bad_factorial 5) |* bad_factorial
    }
